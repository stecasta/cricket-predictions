    "Overall, I would use Kubeflow to orchestrate tasks, keep track of experiments/models and serve in production. Kubeflow is a workflow management system optimized for machine learning. It runs on kubernetes and it can be integrated into the AWS environment with EKS.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, I would make two accounts, one for development and one for production, so that it is easier to separate costs and also makes it harder for developers to accidentaly modify production setup by limiting its access. Depending on the people available in the team, we could set up also a staging account (with the same architecture as the prod environment), for testing before real deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can store previous seasons data on a S3 bucket. Since the total data available is around 2.5 TB, and we don't expect exponential increase in the near future, this will suffice. If needed, we can also add an RDS instance to store structured data like game metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers can access the data with containerized Jupyter notebooks, ensuring high reproducibility. Each experiment is tracked with kubeflow (integration of other tools like w&b also possible) and the models + training artifacts are stored in a S3 bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the developers set a new model as baseline, they can define a Kubeflow pipeline to automate model training. This includes retrieving the data, preprocessing and doing the actual training on a AWS machine with GPU. Each step of the pipeline runs in a container that a developer previously pushed to a container registry. This approach ensures reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the production side, we also have a Kubeflow cluster. As soon as the game data is ready (this could be triggered by an API call or an event) a lambda function is run and it launches the inference of the model.  Ideally, the data is already available on an S3 bucket in the production account. We can then store results and metadata in an RDS SQL database and potentially transfer the data to the dev account for future retraining. By using Kubernetes, we can adjust the number of active nodes based on the number of concurrent requests, making this architecture inherently scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Registration of containers to the registry as well as model deployment and testing can be automated with CI/CD linked to pull requests in the git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of costs, for the storage of past games we would spend either 405$ or 121$ depending on the urgency of retrainings (instant retrieval for the former and up to 12hrs for the latter). Given that we can shut down nodes when we don't use time, inference time in a year is 500 hours. We can further reduce costs by choosing spot instances since we don't need to operate in real time. We can then choose an instance like a m6g.medium, with 4GiB of memory and a single core. This will give a yearly cost of 17.75$. \n",
    "For training the model the choice will depend if we need access to machines with GPUs. Since we are dealing with videos, this is very likely. We can then choose a g3s.xlarge with 8Gb of vRAM and 4 CPUs, coming at a hourly cost of 0.225$ for spot intances. If we consider 1 retraining per week during the season (~32), the cost is 32x8x0.225=57.6$\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing it up, considering periodic retraining, the main fixed cost for this architecture is around 195$ per year."
